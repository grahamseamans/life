✅ **Dichotomy of Control – Focus only on what you can change.**  
📖 *“Some things are up to us and some are not.”* (*Epictetus, Enchiridion 1*)

📖 *“What injures the hive, injures the bee.”* (*Marcus Aurelius, Meditations 6.54*)

✅ **Act with Justice, Courage, Wisdom, and Temperance – The Four Cardinal Virtues.**  
📖 *“No man can live a happy life if he thinks only of himself and turns everything to his own advantage. You must live for your neighbor if you would live for yourself.”* (*Seneca, Letters 48*)  

✅ **Do Not Waste Time – Your life is limited, use it wisely.**  
📖 *“It is not that we have a short space of time, but that we waste much of it.”* (*Seneca, On the Shortness of Life 1.1*)

✅ **Endure Insults & Hardship – You are not harmed unless you believe you are harmed.**  
📖 *“If someone succeeds in provoking you, realize that your mind is complicit in the provocation.”* (*Epictetus, Enchiridion 20*)

📖 *“Wealth consists not in having great possessions, but in having few wants.”* (*Epictetus, Discourses 1.15.2*)
